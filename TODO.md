# AI Enhancement & New Features TODO

## Steps to Complete (Based on Approved Plan & User Feedback)

- [x] Step 1: Test Chatbot - Launch dev server (already running), use browser to interact with floating-chatbot at / (or dedicated page), send queries (e.g., "Cum aplic la un job in Danemarca?"), verify OpenRouter responses (network tab), fallback if API fails, ensure 200 OK and natural flow. Update with results. (Completed: User confirmed working; endpoint integrated with real AI)

- [x] Step 2: Bilingual Support - Add i18n (next-intl or react-i18next) for Romanian (default) and Danish. Create translation files (JSON for pages/components like landing, contact, evaluare-cv). Update layout.tsx for language switcher (dropdown for RO/DA). Prioritize employer sections (job-post-form, dashboard). Test switching. (Completed: next-intl integrated, translations for landing/contact/CV/guide/verified jobs, language switcher functional, tested switching)

- [x] Step 3: AI-Powered Danish Flashcards - Enhance learn/danish/page.tsx with Anki-like flashcards. Use OpenRouter to generate cards (prompt: "Generate 10 Danish vocab flashcards for job seekers from Romanian: words for agriculture/farm work"). Add flip animation (framer-motion), spaced repetition (localStorage or DB). Integrate with chatbot for personalized cards. (Completed: framer-motion flip animation, localStorage spaced repetition, chatbot integration for personalized cards, translations added)

- [x] Step 4: Brainstorm Ideas - Generate ideas for AI features (e.g., voice chat for Danish practice, AI interview simulator, automated job alert emails). Document in scratchpad.md or new IDEAS.md. Include monetization (premium flashcards, employer analytics). (Completed: Documented in scratchpad.md)

- [x] Step 5: Web Scraping Tool for Agent - Create new API route /api/scrape-danish-farms: Use Puppeteer (install if needed) to scrape sites like landbrugsavisen.dk or krak.dk for farm companies in Denmark. Extract boss emails (via hunter.io API or regex). Use OpenRouter to generate personalized outreach emails ("Propose partnership for Romanian workers"). Send via Nodemailer. Add cron job (node-cron) for weekly runs. Ethical note: Respect robots.txt, GDPR. (Completed: crawl4ai scraper, OpenRouter email generation, Nodemailer integration, cron job, DB logging)

- [x] Step 6: Automation Triggers - Integrate n8n (docker-compose add n8n service) or Make.com webhook. Create workflow: Trigger on schedule -> Run scraping -> AI outreach generation -> Send emails. Test with mock data. Alternative: Serverless with Vercel cron. (Completed: n8n service added to docker-compose.yml with SQLite database. n8n is running at http://localhost:5678 (admin/securepass456). To create workflow: Access n8n UI, create workflow with Schedule Trigger -> HTTP Request to http://host.docker.internal:3000/api/scrape-danish-farms (when Next.js dev server is running). For production, use Vercel cron as alternative.)

- [x] Step 7: Phase 1 Completion - Admin system implemented with full access controls. Admin user created (ionutbaltag3@gmail.com / ancutadavid_24A). Admin dashboard with stats, user/job management navigation. Ready for semantic search and CV analysis enhancement.

## âœ… Admin System Implementation Complete

### Database Changes
- Added ADMIN role to UserRole enum
- Applied migration `add-admin-role`
- Created admin user in seed script

### Admin Features
- Admin dashboard at `/admin` with system statistics
- Admin navigation link (red button) for admin users only
- Admin stats API endpoint `/api/admin/stats`
- Role-based access control throughout the application

### Admin Credentials
- **Email:** ionutbaltag3@gmail.com
- **Password:** ancutadavid_24A
- **Role:** ADMIN (full system access)

### Next Steps for Phase 2
- Implement semantic search with pgvector
- Enhance CV analysis with AI embeddings
- Add job creation embedding generation
- Add resume upload embedding generation
- Implement semantic job-CV matching

Progress: All Phase 1 features completed successfully. Ready for Phase 2 semantic search implementation.
