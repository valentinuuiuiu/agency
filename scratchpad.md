## AI Feature Brainstorm & Monetization Ideas

### AI Features
These ideas build on the existing OpenRouter integration for text generation, chatbot, and flashcards. Priorities are based on effort (low: 1-2 days; medium: 3-5 days; high: 1 week+) and impact for Romanian job seekers in Danish agriculture/forestry.

1. **Voice Chat for Danish Practice** (Medium effort, High impact)
   - Users practice pronunciation via browser speech-to-text (Web Speech API).
   - OpenRouter analyzes audio transcripts for corrections/feedback (prompt: "Correct Danish pronunciation and suggest improvements for [user input]").
   - Integrate with flashcards for vocab drills. Track progress in localStorage or Prisma DB.
   - Priority: High - Directly addresses language barriers for farm work communication.

2. **AI Interview Simulator** (High effort, High impact)
   - Generate job-specific questions (e.g., "Describe your experience with tree planting" for forestry roles) using OpenRouter based on user's CV/job type.
   - User responds via text/voice; AI scores responses (prompt: "Rate interview answer on clarity, relevance, Danish usage: [response]") and provides tips.
   - Simulate full interviews with follow-ups. Store sessions for review.
   - Priority: High - Prepares users for Danish employer interviews; tie to CV analysis.

3. **Automated Job Alerts** (Low effort, Medium impact)
   - Send personalized emails/SMS (Nodemailer + Twilio) when new jobs match user profile (e.g., agriculture keywords from CV).
   - Use OpenRouter to customize alerts (prompt: "Write friendly job alert email in Romanian/Danish: [job details] for [user skills]").
   - Opt-in via user settings; frequency: daily/weekly.
   - Priority: Medium - Increases engagement; easy win using existing job API.

4. **AI Resume Optimizer** (Medium effort, High impact)
   - Beyond current CV eval: Auto-translate to Danish, suggest keyword additions from job postings (using embeddings via pgvector if implemented).
   - OpenRouter prompt: "Optimize this CV for Danish agriculture jobs: add keywords, rephrase for ATS compatibility."
   - Generate multiple versions (standard/Danish). Integrate with upload flow.
   - Priority: High - Builds on existing CV feature; monetizable as premium.

5. **Role-Play Chatbot Extensions** (Low effort, Medium impact)
   - Extend existing chatbot to simulate scenarios (e.g., "Talk to farm boss about work hours" in Danish/Romanian mix).
   - OpenRouter for dynamic responses (prompt: "Role-play as Danish farm employer responding to [user message]").
   - Add branching based on user choices; log for learning insights.
   - Priority: Medium - Leverages current chatbot; fun way to practice real interactions.

6. **Personalized Learning Dashboard** (High effort, Medium impact)
   - Combine flashcards with progress tracking (spaced repetition scores from localStorage).
   - OpenRouter generates custom paths (prompt: "Create learning plan for [user level] in agriculture Danish vocab").
   - Gamification: Badges for completion, integrate with interview sim.
   - Priority: Medium - Enhances flashcards; requires DB for user data.

7. **Semantic Job Matching** (High effort, High impact)
   - Use pgvector for embeddings on job descriptions vs. CVs (OpenRouter or Hugging Face for vectors).
   - Rank matches with explanations (prompt: "Explain why this job matches user's skills: [comparison]").
   - Dashboard view for users/employers.
   - Priority: High - Core to platform; aligns with Phase 1 TODO.

### Monetization Strategies
Focus on value for job seekers (free tier to attract) and employers (paid for talent access). Estimated revenue potential based on 1K users/100 employers.

1. **Freemium Model** (Primary strategy)
   - Free: Basic chatbot, standard flashcards, simple CV eval.
   - Premium (€4.99/month or €49/year): Unlimited personalized features (custom flashcards, interview sim, advanced CV optimization), ad-free, priority support.
   - Upsell via in-app prompts after free limits (e.g., "Unlock 10 more practice sessions").

2. **Employer Subscriptions** (€19.99/month)
   - Basic free job postings; pro tier for AI candidate matching, analytics (e.g., "Top skills in applicant pool"), automated outreach emails.
   - Value prop: Faster hiring of Romanian workers for farms.

3. **Affiliate & In-App Purchases**
   - One-time buys: €9.99 for full interview prep kit or CV translation pack.
   - Affiliates: 10% commission on successful placements via platform referrals (track with unique links).
   - Sponsored content: Danish farms pay for featured alerts (€50/posting).

4. **Premium Add-Ons** (€2.99 each)
   - Voice practice module or role-play scenarios as unlocks.
   - Bundle with premium for discounts.

5. **Data Insights Sales**
   - Anonymized reports (e.g., "Trending agriculture skills among Romanian seekers") sold to agencies (€99/report quarterly).
   - Ensure GDPR compliance.

Total potential: €5K/month at scale (500 premium users + 50 employer subs). Start with freemium to grow user base, then push employer features.

Implementation Notes: All features leverage existing OpenRouter/AI service. Low-effort first (alerts, role-play). Track via analytics (e.g., Google Analytics or Mixpanel). Legal: GDPR for user data, clear terms for monetization.
